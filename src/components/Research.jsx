            internship, I investigated a novel NFkB pathway by measuring the
            amount of the p50 protein present in A549 cells grown under
            normocapnia and hypercapnia conditions. The techniques gained
            includes Western blot assay, cell culture and Bradford assay. At the
            end of the internship, I presented my findings to the whole
            Pulmonary Department. I attended weekly journal club sessions, with
            other student interns, where I presented my analysis of the research
            papers assigned. This opportunity helped improve my analytical
            skills as well as my appreciation for science.

            Additionally, I examined the cytokines present in the exosomes of
